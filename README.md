Face recognisation system :
  Smart Attendance using Real-Time Face Recognition is a real-world solution 
which comes with day to day activities of handling student attendance system. Face 
recognition-based attendance system is a process of recognizing the students face for 
taking attendance by using face biometrics based on high - definition monitor video 
and other information technology. In my face recognition project, a computer system 
will be able to find and recognize human faces using the webcam. Numerous 
algorithms and techniques have been developed for improving the performance of 
face recognition but the concept to be implemented here is Deep Learning. It helps in 
conversion of the frames of the video into images so that the face of the person can be 
easily recognized for their attendance so that the attendance database can be easily 
reflected automatically.
